## Testing User Stories

User stories are documented in the Cafitio Corner GitHub Projects Board. Each user story includes detailed Acceptance Criteria and Tasks. Testing was conducted using Dev Tools for desktop, tablet, and mobile to ensure that all Acceptance Criteria were met. All features were thoroughly tested to verify that they provided the expected output and actions for the user.
